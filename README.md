# CukeRestSalad

## Who can use this?
This module is intended to help in testing REST services. It gives you an intuitive way of forming a request in multiple steps using Gherkin syntax. Most of the steps needed for calling a request is already implemented. It also has a lot of step definitions for parsing json response and validating different nodes in the response.
Anyone who has json based REST services can use this for testing their services.
